# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
PCA and one-class SVM models are applied on an imbalanced dataset Creditcard, which has 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.

This repository delves into a highly imbalanced dataset of credit card transactions by European cardholders in September 2013. Comparing Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
and One-Class Support Vector Machine (One-Class SVM) for anomaly detection, PCA emerged as the more effective method, outperforming Random Forest on this challenging dataset. 
A crucial aspect is the choice of reconstruction scores in PCA, impacting the identification of fraudulent transactions based on specific business requirements. Precision, 
recall, and F1-score metrics are key in evaluating the model's performance. Feel free to explore the code and adjust thresholds to align with your business objectives.
